# Web Accessibility and Refactoring

## Task

Given a codebase, we are tasked to refactor the files provided to have accessibility using HTML Semantic elements.

## Files

The files used for this task are as follow:
* `index.html`
* `style.css`
* `README.md`

## Refactoring using HTML Semantic Elements

The end goal is to make the source code readable for other developers to debug and understand the breakdown of different sections and elements. 

To make this happen, HTML Semantic elements were adapted in appropriate locations to replace div tags. A result in changing elements in the HTML file, some minor changes were adjusted to CSS file keep the same styling of the page.
